*Collaboration with [Raven Kwok](http://ravenkwok.com)*

_Parallel_ is a music installation which represents the synthesis of MFA thesis work for artist K. Michael Fox surrounding computer music, granular synthesis, and real-time generative music systems. The installation is manifest as a mobile device app, which calls upon its user to collaborate in the create of musical material. When present in the installation setting, the devices may also be networked to communicate information with each other. This positions the audience simultaneously as audience and performer, or listener and speaker, or emitter and receiver, or as creator and consumer. The appâ€™s interface is presented to the user as a biologically inspired digital creature that is manipulable by the user, and subtly impacts the qualities of the sound produced on each device. Fox collaborated with artist Raven Kwok, who designed the visual components of both the mobile app and the installation.
