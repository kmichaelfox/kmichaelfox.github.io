*Collaboration with [Ryan Ross Smith](http://ryanrosssmith.com)*

This is the first in a series of Media Operas. Working with collaborator Ryan Ross Smith, we combined our mutual work and his primary research focus on Animated Music Notations with my explorations of generative text systems. The first iteration of the operas series writes its material, again, just-in-time for the materials performance.
