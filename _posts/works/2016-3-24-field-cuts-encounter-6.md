_Field Cuts: Encounter 6_ is the most recent piece in this performance series which focuses on physical and mental interruption of the performer through electrical muscle/nerve stimulation. This nearly-40-minute piece features three performers moving through cyclical choreography while being interrupted by electrical impulses and modifying their performances in response to these impulses.

The computer generated score (programmed in openFrameworks) assigns virtual connections between performers, where one performer's movement causes impulses to be sent to another performer's body.

Encounter 6, the latest performance in this project, was premiered at EMPAC Studio 2 in Troy, NY in March 2016 in collaboration with K. Michael Fox (sound design / programming), Meghan Anderson (performer / movement), Jacob Regan (performer), and Haley Day (performer).
