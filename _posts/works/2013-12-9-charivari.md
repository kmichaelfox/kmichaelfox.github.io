This installation features a self-organizing, generatively modeled system of sound ‘organisms’ inhabiting a virtual space. The 8-speaker surround system maps the location of the organisms in the virtual space to the physical space of the room. These organisms develop their sound over time through a process of communication. One may perceive the subtle variations that emerge through this generative process.
