I've finally gotten around to addressing my website. This is mostly because I got tired of seeing how many bots were visiting my site just to try to crack WordPress security. So, out with WP and in with the Jekyll version.

I used to love playing around with Ruby but found Rails to be a bit of a chore, so it is nice to have Jekyll as an excuse to _occasionally_ play around with Ruby again.

It is my intention to also update this space a bit more often than I did on the WP version. We'll see how well I can stick to that promise...
